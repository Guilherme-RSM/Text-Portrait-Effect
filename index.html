          <h2>The Guy Fawkes mask</h2>
          <p>Guy Fawkes (York, April 13, 1570 - London, January 31, 1606), also known as Guido Fawkes, name adopted while fighting in Spain, was an English Catholic soldier who took part in the "Powder Conspiracy" in which he took part. he intended to assassinate the Protestant King James I of England and the members of the English Parliament during a session in 1605, thus starting a Catholic uprising. Guy Fawkes was responsible for guarding the powder kegs that would be used to explode in Parliament during the session.

            Guy was born and raised in York. His father died when Guy was just 8 years old. His mother eventually married a Catholic adept at "refusal". Guy converted to Catholicism and left the mainland, where he fought in the Eighty Years' War on the side of Catholic Spain against the Protestant Dutch. He traveled across Spain seeking support for a Catholic uprising in England, but without success. Later, he would meet Robert Wintour and Thomas Wintour, who would also become involved in the Gunpowder Plot.

            Wintour introduced Guy to Robert Catesby, who planned the assassination of King James I to put a Catholic monarch on the throne. The conspirators rented a space under the House of Lords, where Guy stored several powder kegs. Receiving an anonymous tip through a letter, like Palace of Westminster officials, Guy Fawkes, and gunpowder in the early morning hours of November 5th. In the following days, he would be tortured and interrogated, where he confessed his participation in the conspiracy. Soon after, on January 31, Guy was hanged and then mutilated. Other participants in the conspiracy ended up having the same fate.

            Guy Fawkes has become the symbol of the Gunpowder Plot, as it has been celebrated on November 5th since its execution.</p>
